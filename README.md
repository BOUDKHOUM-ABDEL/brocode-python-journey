A hands-on Python learning journey inspired by BroCode’s YouTube tutorials.
This repo documents my transition into Python from C, C++
— building on prior programming experience to explore Python’s syntax, paradigms, and libraries. It includes foundational concepts, mini-projects, and coding exercises 
— from variables and loops to GUIs and beyond. Ideal for coders who learn best by doing and want to deepen their Python fluency through practical application.
